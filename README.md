# arknights-operator-viewer

This is an Android Application that allows users to read about the lore of Arknights characters and view their images and trust file archives. Arknights is a mobile game that has a very diverse cast of characters, and this app puts all of the character's information together for easy reading. Each character has their own personalized page that includes their image, class type, skill images, affiliation, and their profile and trust archives. These pages are built by reading and parsing a file, but I am working on transitioning from a file to a database and receiving the data through SQL.

Not all of the operators have been added yet, and not all of the functionality and UI elements are implemented yet because this is a current project. However, there is enough work finished that this could be considered a successful POC.
